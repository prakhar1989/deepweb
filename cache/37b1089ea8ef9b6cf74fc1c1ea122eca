Football for Hope aids social organisations in Brazil

   (FIFA.com) 10 May 2014

   The Football for Hope adidas Exchange Programme arrived in Brazil this
   week, with a three-day workshop held in Rio de Janeiro on 7-9 May.
   Bringing together nearly 100 people who were full of ideas and ready to
   learn and swap information, the workshop is part of the collaboration
   between FIFA and adidas to strengthen the know-how of NGOs in Brazil
   and abroad.

   Organised at a local level by the Karanba social project, the adidas
   Exchange Programme - Brazil involves over 40 non-governmental
   organisations with an interest in exchanging know-how and expertise and
   in receiving training on mobilising resources, fundraising strategies
   and football coaching.
   "Football For Hope is a concept, and one of FIFA's philosophies is to
   recognise that the people with the best insight into the problematic
   social issues affecting communities all over the world are local
   people," said Federico Addiechi, FIFA's Head of Corporate Social
   Responsibility.

   "Solutions must be local too," he added. "Our role is not to implement
   FIFA programmes in communities, but to recognise the intense efforts
   organisations are making in supporting that work. Here we have the
   opportunity to combine two things: FIFA's ongoing Football For Hope
   movement and the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil(TM). That's why we have so
   many organisations taking part. This is the biggest programme that
   we've implemented yet. It's going to leave a very important legacy too,
   one that shows the many positive things football has to offer our
   society."

   Gudrun Veronika Messias, Sustainability Manager at adidas, was equally
   positive about the project. "At adidas we strongly believe in the power
   of sport in transforming people's lives," she said. "This is why we
   support the Football For Hope adidas Exchange Program. The Exchange
   Program has as its objective to train social organizations in how to
   use sport as a tool for social change.

     This is the biggest programme that we've implemented yet. It's going
     to leave a very important legacy.

     Federico Addiechi, FIFA's Head of Corporate Social Responsibility

   "We are certain of the success and the positive impact made by this
   second Exchange Program in Brazil, hosted by Karanba in Rio de Janeiro.
   Not only due to the important content discussed during the workshops
   and practical sessions, but also through the informal best practice
   sharing between the participants from organisations all over Brazil.
   Adidas is proud to be part of this."

   In terms of development and training, the adidas Exchange Programme
   features sessions in which organisations can work together and discuss
   existing practices, the keys to success and the measures needed to
   bring about improvements in previously identified areas of expertise.
   Specialists are also asked to come along and share knowledge of their
   fields with participants.
   "The workshop has given us a better understanding of the aspects that
   are essential to training and in ensuring that the project that we put
   forward for funding under the Incentive Act is a quality one,"
   commented Fernanda Desbesel Appelt, project manager at the Lenon Joel
   Pela Paz Institute, which works with children and teenagers in Sao
   Leopoldo, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, and which is looking to
   attract state funding through the Incentive Act.

   She added: "When it comes to communications, we're building on what we
   already do, which is to bring partners and the local community into
   contact with each other. The thing is, we want to do this using tools
   that are easy for us to access but which we don't have many of, and we
   want to make them work."
   In terms of football itself, the adidas Exchange Programme is based on
   the Coerver Method and offers advanced training to local-community
   coaches in a course lasting 12-14 hours and featuring practical and
   theory-based modules. In completing the course, coaches acquire the
   skills they need to implement better programmes and are also able to
   share those skills with other coaches in their communities.
   "The programme really opened my eyes," said Alan Frank da Gama Nunes,
   an instructor at the Amazonia Institute of Development, Education and
   Culture (Idesca), which uses football and futsal to improve the lives
   of children in the Manaus area.

   "I learned some new exercises and a new way of working with time, like
   how to show children a passing drill in three minutes and then move on
   to passing and moving before gradually getting them to pass, move and
   dribble," he continued. "I'm going away very happy. I've learned things
   and I've met people. We've swapped email addresses and we're going to
   stay in touch. The future looks very promising."

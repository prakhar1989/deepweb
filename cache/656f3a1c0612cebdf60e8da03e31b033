Female leaders to meet in Zurich as part of FIFA development programme

   (FIFA.com) 23 Sep 2015

   The talented women involved in the inaugural edition of FIFA's Female
   Leadership Development Programme will head to Zurich next week as
   module two of the nine-month programme gets underway.

   In addition to the 35 participants, a group of more than 20 mentors
   from across the globe will meet to take part in practical training
   sessions set to take place at the Home of FIFA between 28 September and
   2 October. It follows on from the first module of the programme, which
   kicked off in Vancouver just prior to the FIFA Women's World Cup Canada
   2015(TM) final, while the third module will also take place at the Home
   of FIFA from 29 February to 3 March 2016.

   "This programme is about identifying, supporting and developing strong
   female leaders in football, which is in line with calls for greater
   female representation across all areas of the game," says Moya Dodd,
   FIFA Executive Committee co-opted member and chair of the [70]Task
   Force for Women's Football. "As one of the mentors, I am looking
   forward to exchanging ideas during next week's workshop and seeing the
   progress that has been made by the participants on their personal
   projects that will translate into tangible benefits for women's
   football."

   The Female Leadership Development Programme is part of FIFA's
   commitment to its [71]ten key development principles for women's
   football and follows on from the inaugural FIFA Women's Football and
   Leadership Conference held in [72]March 2015, when experts from
   football, business and wider society discussed ways to improve the
   representation of women in leadership. The objective is to increase the
   number of female leaders and role models in football. This includes at
   executive committee level in all governing bodies, which will enhance
   football governance and improve the game overall.

     The initiative is bringing together gifted female leaders from all
     over the world - women who have faced many challenges to succeed in
     football.

     Mayrilian Cruz Blanco, FIFA Senior Women's Football Development
     Manager.

   The programme is being designed and delivered in partnership with the
   [73]THNK School of Creative Leadership. [74]Natasha Bonnevalle, THNK
   Expert on Women's Leadership, says the organisation's uniquely designed
   "Creation Flow" methodology will help the participants develop their
   own leadership skills as well as their real-world project.

   "There are so many arenas today that we can't imagine ever existed
   without the integrated voices of female leaders - without women on the
   inside who have decision-making clout," says Bonnevalle. "There's
   progress and incentive to change on so many fronts, but not as much in
   sport as there should be. Sport ignites a distinct kind of strength,
   autonomy, and energy in young girls. The more we foster that kind of
   fire-lighting - whether it's on the athletic side or the corporate -
   the more the industry will grow for the better."

   All the participants have played a role at one of FIFA's 209 member
   associations and/or at the confederations or at FIFA itself, and come
   from a wide range of backgrounds and organisations.

   "The initiative is bringing together gifted female leaders from all
   over the world - women who have faced many challenges to succeed in
   football," says Mayrilian Cruz Blanco, FIFA Senior Women's Football
   Development Manager. "They all have the support and backing of their
   respective confederations or member associations to take part. For
   instance, Paraguay's Lorena Soto, who was recently appointed Head of
   Women's Football for CONMEBOL, will be leading a crucial project to
   transform the state of women's football in South America."

   Felicite Rwemalika, who oversees women's football for the Rwanda
   Football Association and is taking part in the first edition, says:
   "This is an inspiring programme that will lead me to another level.
   Women's empowerment through football has been my dream."

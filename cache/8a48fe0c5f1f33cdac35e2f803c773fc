   2014 FIFA World Cup

Leandrinho, the NBA's soccer missionary

   (FIFA.com) 22 Jun 2012
   Brazilian basketball star Leandrinho Barbosa meets Ronaldinho Gaúcho
     *
     *

   [70] Listen

   In signing for NBA franchise Phoenix Suns in 2003, Leandro Barbosa knew
   he was taking up the position as an ambassador for Brazilian
   basketball. What he perhaps could not foresee, however, was that he
   would also help spread the gospel of football, the sport he played most
   in his childhood years.

   Barbosa's arrival in a side that featured Canadian point guard Steve
   Nash, a diehard Tottenham Hotspur fan and a co-owner of MLS outfit
   Vancouver Whitecaps, triggered a wave of appreciation for five-time
   world champions Brazil in the NBA. As one of four Brazilian players in
   the championship, the guard, who now plays for Indiana Pacers, was
   regularly sought out by team-mates and opponents anxious for his views
   on the game they call soccer stateside.

   In the first of a special series of interviews in which Brazilian
   personalities from outside the world of football talk about the game
   and the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil(TM), FIFA.com spoke to Leandrinho in
   his native Sao Paulo, where he is currently preparing for the London
   Olympics.

   Aside from revealing who the NBA's soccer experts are, he also shared
   his views on Brazil 2014 and his beloved Corinthians, his affections
   for them remaining undimmed despite a brief spell with Flamengo
   Basketball during last year's NBA lockout.

   FIFA.com: Is it true that you're a good footballer, and if so are you
   good with your feet? You're 6'3 which is not that tall for a basketball
   player but pretty tall for a footballer.
   Leandrinho: Look, I can play a bit. Some people said I would have made
   a good centre-half, and others reckoned I could have been a decent
   attacking player because I've got a good burst of speed. Maybe I'm not
   the best person to ask, but I can turn quickly on the ball. Footballers
   are generally pretty small and there are only one or two big players
   around.

   Have you always played football?
   I always wanted to play football when I was a boy, but it was hard to
   get a break because there was so much competition, and no club ever
   came in for me. I played in the street, sometimes in bare feet, scoring
   goals with the rest of the kids and playing four-a-side games. The
   thing was, my older brother played basketball and I ended up following
   in his footsteps.

   Were you already a Corinthians fan by then?
   I was born a Corinthians fan. When I was a baby and my father sat me on
   his lap, he would use a piece of black and white cloth to tie me to
   him, to make sure I didn't fall. That's what my mother and brothers
   spoke about. I never went to the stadium because we had very little
   money, but when the matches were on TV I watched them at home or went
   with my dad to local bars showing the games. There were a lot of
   Corinthians fans in the area. Thanks to my dad I became a huge
   supporter, and the happiest time I remember was when Edilson, Vampeta
   and Ricardinho were in the side (together the trio helped O Timão win
   two Brazilian titles and the FIFA Club World Cup Brazil 2000). Not many
   teams have brought as much happiness to Corinthians fans as that one.

     Here in MLS, the game's been getting a lot more attention since
     David Beckham arrived at LA Galaxy, and then with Thierry Henry,
     who's another famous face. The stadiums are always full.

     Leandrinho, Phoenix Suns' Brazilian basketball star

   Do you still follow them from the USA?
   I watch the games on cable TV, on a channel that shows matches from all
   over the world. I've got TV Globo too and whenever I've got time I'll
   sit down and watch a game.

   What's your view of the game today in the USA?
   People follow it a lot now and they watch football from everywhere:
   Brazil, Europe and MLS. We've got Neymar, who's a great player and is
   very popular abroad. Everyone asks me if he's really that good a
   player. I'm always telling people how good and how strong Brazilian
   football is because it's attracting a lot of overseas players, isn't
   it? Here in MLS, the game's been getting a lot more attention since
   David Beckham arrived at LA Galaxy, and then with Thierry Henry, who's
   another famous face. The stadiums are always full.

   Tell us about the stars of NBA and their appreciation of football. You
   sometimes have a game on the court, don't you?
   I always wanted a game when I was at Phoenix Suns but there was no one
   to play with. When Steve Nash joined the team it was great. We'd finish
   training and then we'd be straight off to play football.

   He's one of the best point guards around, but is he a good footballer?
   He's very good. He plays football in the same way he plays basketball
   and if he wanted to play for a team, I'm sure he'd end up at a pretty
   good one. He's mad about the game, so much so that he's organising a
   charity match in New York next Wednesday. He's got some NBA people
   involved and football players from England too. Henry's also going to
   be there. We've become good friends with him since he came to New York
   and he's a really nice guy. It's going to be basketball players against
   the footballers and we want to win.

   Who else plays the game?
   At Phoenix there's Boris Diaw, who's French. He's very tall but he's
   skilful. And there's also Goran Dragic, who's from Slovenia.  One guy
   who can play a bit too and who totally knocked us out is Shaquille
   O'Neal. He's great in goal. He's 7'1 tall, and he likes diving around,
   so we put a mat on the floor after training and made some goals. He
   loved it and he was always ready to take you on. After that the whole
   team joined in. At Indiana there's George Hill, who was a goalkeeper at
   college. And then at Toronto Raptors there was Jose Calderon of Spain.
   We've got a bit of a rivalry going because he supports Real Madrid and
   I love Barcelona. We always have a bet whenever there's a clásico. When
   I left Toronto, Madrid beat Barcelona and he called me asking for his
   money, but I couldn't pay him because I'd gone.

   Brazil will be hosting the FIFA World Cup in two years' time. What are
   your expectations for the tournament?
   I can hardly wait. I think it's going to be crazy, and the whole nation
   is going to be jumping. There's no more passionate country than Brazil.
   We saw what Sao Paulo was like this week with Corinthians in the [Copa]
   Libertadores. Can you imagine the whole country like that?

   One last question, what's your biggest FIFA World Cup memory?
   I've watched a few but I've never actually been to one. USA 1994 was
   the one that made the biggest impression on me. I was 12 at the time
   and I remember the celebrations. Bebeto and Romario were there and
   Ronaldo was just breaking through. It was a brilliant achievement, the
   first World Cup win in 24 years, and that title stuck in my mind for
   many years.

The importance of a good warm-up

   The sight of substitutes jogging and sprinting along the touchline or
   following the action while performing a stretching exercise or two is
   commonplace during games.

   To most fans, these activities might look relatively innocuous and not
   particularly strenuous, but experts are agreed that the pre-match
   warm-up plays a vital part in enhancing player performance and reducing
   the risk of injury.

   As the game becomes ever more competitive and demanding, so the need
   for greater specialisation in all areas related to football grows,
   among them physical preparation, a field that has witnessed significant
   developments in recent years. And as numerous in-depth studies have
   revealed, the right kind of warm-up routine can provide effective
   protection against injuries.

   Four good reasons
   The reasons for warming up before taking part in any physical exercise
   are fourfold: To raise the body temperature; increase metabolic
   activity; quicken the heartbeat and breathing rate; and prepare the
   muscles and nervous system for exercise. Furthermore, such exercises
   encourage the psychological stimulation of the player, allowing him or
   her to reach the level of concentration required to ensure optimal
   performance.

   Oscar Garcia, fitness coach with Spanish Primera Liga outfit Getafe,
   explains the benefits of warming up further.

   " And as they contract that also improves speed and strength. It also
   activates the cardiovascular and respiratory systems with the result
   that heartbeat and the circulation of blood around the body increases.

     It's been proven that warming up has a series of positive
     effects on the body as it raises the temperature of the
     muscles.

     Oscar Garcia, fitness coach at Getafe, stresses the positive effects
     of warming-up.

   "As a result more nutritional substances and oxygen are supplied to the
   muscles, helping them contract and also encouraging the dispersal of
   by-products such as carbon dioxide and lactic acid. What is more,
   warming up improves coordination and boosts players' concentration
   during games."

   Eleven ways to prevent injuries
   In co-operation with a group of international experts, FIFA's Medical
   Assessment and Research Centre (F-MARC) has developed a very simple yet
   highly effective injury prevention programme entitled 'The 11' for
   amateur players, a series of ten functional exercises that can be
   completed in around 15 minutes with the aid of a ball. Especially
   designed to prevent injuries, 'The 11' should be carried out in each
   training session as part of the warm-up . A shortened version of the
   routine (exercises 4, 5 and 8 only) should also be performed before
   each match.

   "Regularly performing this programme does reduce the frequency of
   injuries in football," says Prof. Jiri Dvorak, FIFA Chief Medical
   Officer and Chairman of F-MARC. " ." The programme is available here on
   FIFA.com.
   We usually see teams come out on the pitch about half an hour before
   kick-off to go through their final warm-up routines. These normally
   include a series of aerobic exercises without the use of a ball,
   starting with a gentle jog.

     We strongly recommend to every player to perform the exercises of
     'The 11' as part of their playing routine, whether they are
     a professional or just kick the ball in their leisure
     time

     Prof. Jiri Dvorak on the benefits of 'The 11'

   Dressed in their sweatshirts, the players then engage in some
   stretching exercises, with special attention being paid to key areas
   such as knees, abductor muscles and leg muscles. To round off the
   warm-up, players should do a little ball work, following a plan that
   starts with team exercises and ends with individual ones. Naturally,
   goalkeepers ought to follow a separate programme to their team-mates as
   that is a position requiring altogether different preparations.

   Ways and means
   Although the effects of the warm-up can be noted within a matter of
   five minutes, it should ideally last for more than 20 minutes. As well
   as taking into account the physical condition of the player, these
   routines should also consider factors such as the weather. On hot days
   less time should be spent on warming up, with the reverse being the
   case in cooler conditions. The appropriate clothing should also be
   worn.

   Players need to warm up not just before matches but also prior to their
   daily training sessions. The intensity of the exercises should increase
   gradually although it is important coaches do not to wear their players
   out by making them warm up for too long.

   So as you can see, there is a very good reason why substitutes get up
   off the bench and limber up pitchside, and coaches should make sure
   they are given enough time to prepare properly before sending them on
   to the field of play. However, the positive influence of warm-up does
   not apply only to professional players. It is as important and
   effective for everyone playing football just for fun - and helps in
   ensuring that the fun lasts.

FIFA aids Philippines' football renewal

   (FIFA.com) 05 Mar 2014
   Inspection visit in Philippines

   While Tuesday's high-profile FIFA-supported Annual Match against
   Poverty in Bern provided much needed money in the wake of November's
   devastating Typhoon Haiyan, football's world governing body are also
   supplying funds and assistance for the rebuilding of football
   infrastructure in the Philippines.

   A FIFA delegation recently finished a three-day assessment of Tacloban,
   located in the eastern island of Leyte in the Philippines, which was
   one of the worst hit areas when Typhoon Haiyan rocked the south-east
   Asian nation last November. Part of the delegation's aim was to assess
   how best to assist locals revive football activities.

   In December the FIFA Finance Committee confirmed a special grant of $1
   million USD to the rebuilding of the damaged football infrastructure
   and facilities in the Philippines.

   Three months after the disaster the city of 200,000 inhabitants and the
   surrounding areas still show tragic evidence of widespread and
   significant destruction.

   With winds up to 300 kilometers per hour most houses and buildings were
   destroyed, while an enormous Tsunami flooded the city. Officially over
   8,000 people lost their lives in the disaster and it is estimated that
   the actual death toll is much higher. About 60 per cent of the
   population have yet to return to their homes and only around 30 per
   cent of the city has electricity.

   Return to football
   The FIFA delegation visited the site of the former Leyte FA which had
   been reduced to rubble, with staff narrowly escaping with their lives.
   A highly active regional football association, the Leyte FA, as part of
   the normalisation and rehabilitation process, is now looking to open up
   opportunities to bring football back to being a regular part of life,
   with many football pitches covered by makeshift classrooms or refugee
   tents.

   Discussions centered on utilising a portion of FIFA's financial
   donation for a Training Centre Project near the city centre.

   "This location would allow easy access to all the children from
   Tacloban and surroundings but could also serve as a regional centre for
   the whole affected area of Eastern Visayas (Leyte and Samar islands),"
   said Dan Palami, President of the Leyte FA.
   "As it would include an artificial turf, it could serve also as the
   future home ground for local teams, a venue for grassroots festivals
   and potentially a training centre for national team camps."

   The FIFA delegation, at a meeting in the capital Manila with
   representatives of the Philippines Football Federation, agreed to
   provide a large quantity of football material, which will be used for
   FIFA/PFF Grassroots activities in the affected areas.

   "In the coming months we'll work hand in hand with the Philippine
   Football Federation to contribute to the normalisation of football
   activities in the most affected areas," said Thierry Regenass, FIFA
   Director of Development & Member Associations.

   "We also look forward to the implementation of activities with UNDP
   (United Nations Development Programme), since we both aim at using
   football as a tool to promote development in the Philippines."

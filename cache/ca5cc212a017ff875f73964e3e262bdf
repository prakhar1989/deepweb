UNIFESP unveiled as FIFA Medical Centre of Excellence

   (FIFA.com) 03 Jul 2013
   UNIFESP unveiled as FIFA Medical Centre of Excellence
     *
     *
     *

   The Federal University of Sao Paulo (UNIFESP) has been officially
   inaugurated as a FIFA Medical Centre of Excellence by FIFA Chief
   Medical Officer, Prof Jiri Dvorak, at an official ceremony held in Sao
   Paulo on Monday 1 July.

   UNIFESP is the second Brazilian centre to receive such an honour, and
   joins a prestigious list of 33 medical centres and clinics worldwide
   who have also been accredited to this high standard.
   According to Moises Cohen, co-ordinator of UNIFESP: "The aim of the
   worldwide network of FIFA Medical Centre of Excellence is to improve
   the healthcare of footballers and other athletes. The UNIFESP Centre
   will focus on prevention treatment, multidisciplinary treatment,
   scientific researches and new technology in surgery."
   The UNIFESP Centre will be working in conjunction with the University
   of Sao Paulo, co-ordinated by Dr Andre Pedrinelli. It will be its first
   experience as a FIFA Medical Centre, which could prove very important
   for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil(TM) and could give support to a city
   which has a population of 20 million.

   The Centre will also be generally open to every player looking for
   therapy or a second opinion on a specific illness or injury. Jorge
   Pagura, the medical chief from the Paulista Football Federation, said
   that he will give all the support to collect data and develop new
   research in order to prevent injuries.

   The table was composed by the rector of the university, director of the
   medical school, the sports secretaries of the city and the state,
   Moises Cohen and Jiri Dworak. During the accreditation ceremony, many
   important footballers were present, such as USA 1994 winner Zetti,
   former Inter Milan and Brazil midfielder Ze Elias, and ex-Corinthians
   star Basilio.
   Clodoaldo, who helped Brazil win Mexico 1970 before his career was cut
   short due to injury, labelled UNIFESP "essential for the treatment of
   athletes" and lamented the fact he did not have the centre at his
   disposal during his playing days.
   Since opening its doors in 1997, the UNIFESP Centre has become an
   internationally renowned clinic that has provided medical care to all
   levels of sportspeople, from amateur athletes to Olympic champions.
   UNIFESP has more than 100 experts associated from sports physicians,
   physiotherapy, acupuncture, radiological experts, sports psychology,
   nutrition, exercise physiology, sports cardiology, and sports medicine
   surgeon experts.
